              Hello, my name is <Strong>Ibrahim Dembele</Strong> and I am{" "}
              <Strong>22 years old</Strong>. I currently reside in{" "}
              <Strong>Toulouse</Strong>. As a web developer, my main focus is on
              creating websites using <Strong>React</Strong>,{" "}
              <Strong>TypeScript</Strong>, and <Strong>Node.js</Strong>. I have
              always had a passion for web development and this interest was
              sparked back in <Strong>2014</Strong> when I took some courses on
              HTML and CSS through OpenClassroom. Since then, I have continued
              to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest web
              development trends and technologies. I enjoy the challenge of
              creating dynamic and user-friendly websites that provide a great
              user experience.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              Since <Strong>March 2020</Strong>, I have been actively using{" "}
              <Strong>React and Node.js</Strong> in my web development projects.
              During this time, I had the opportunity to complete a 2-month
              internship with a startup called <Strong>Ecocote</Strong>, where I
              worked extensively with both React and Node.js. This experience
              motivated me to further specialize in these technologies, and I
              started working on <Strong>projects at home</Strong> to improve my
              skills, specifically focusing on{" "}
              <Strong>React in TypeScript</Strong> and little bit of{" "}
              <Strong>Node.js</Strong>.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              Having <Strong>gained confidence</Strong> in my abilities, I am
              now <Strong>seeking an opportunity</Strong> to turn my passion
              into a career. Currently, I work part-time for{" "}
              <Strong>Deliveroo and Uber</Strong> three days a week, and the
              rest of my time is spent working at home with{" "}
              <Strong>React and TypeScript</Strong>. I am actively seeking
              employment with a company that can offer me a chance to utilize my
              skills and make my dream of becoming a professional web developer
              a reality.
